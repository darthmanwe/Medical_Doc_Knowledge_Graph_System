Multiple risk factors: HTN, age, family hx (father MI at 58).\"\n\n### Supporting Risk Factors:\nThe Knowledge Graph shows Peter Fern has multiple cardiovascular risk factors through these relationships:\n- Peter Julius Fern -[HAS_RISK_FACTOR]-> Age 62 (from Subjective section)\n- Peter Julius Fern -[HAS_RISK_FACTOR]-> Male gender (from Subjective section)  \n- Peter Julius Fern -[HAS_RISK_FACTOR]-> Family History of Myocardial Infarction (father had MI at 58, from Assessment section)\n- Peter Julius Fern -[HAS_CONDITION]-> Hypertension with \"borderline control; adherence inconsistent\" (from Assessment section)\n\n### Symptom Pattern Supporting Angina:\nThe exertional chest tightness follows a classic anginal pattern:\n- Peter Julius Fern -[EXHIBITS_SYMPTOM]-> Chest tightness with \"pressure, not sharp\" quality lasting \"2-4 minutes\"\n- Peter Julius Fern -[EXHIBITS_SYMPTOM]-> Exertional discomfort\n- Symptoms occur \"2-3x/week when walking uphill or carrying groceries\" and are \"relieved by rest\" (from Subjective section)\n\n## Conditions Ruled Out:\n\n**Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)** is explicitly considered unlikely despite the patient having this condition. The relationship Peter Julius Fern -[HAS_CONDITION]-> Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease exists, but the Assessment section states: \"GERD \u2014 chronic but unlikely to explain exertional symptoms.\" The patient also reports this feels \"different and not meal-related.\"\n\n## Reasoning Path Through the Graph:\n\nThe diagnostic reasoning follows this path:\n1. **Risk Factors** (Age 62, Male gender, Family History of MI, Hypertension) \u2192 **Increased cardiovascular risk**\n2. **Exertional Symptoms** (Chest tightness with exertion, relieved by rest) \u2192 **Classic anginal pattern**  \n3. **Multiple Risk Factors + Exertional Pattern** \u2192 **Likely stable angina**\n\nThe clinical plan supports this assessment by prescribing nitroglycerin for exertional discomfort and ordering perfusion imaging to further evaluate cardiac function (from Plan section in Task_Files/soap_notes.txt).\n\n**Note**: The context doesn't contain enough information about other potential conditions like pulmonary causes or musculoskeletal etiologies that could theoretically cause exertional symptoms, as these are not represented in the provided Knowledge Graph entities and relationships.",

The elevated blood pressure reading (152/88 mmHg) combined with the documented medication non-adherence demonstrates how poor compliance leads to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. The physician's emphasis on reinforcing daily adherence in the treatment plan confirms this causal relationship between medication compliance and blood pressure management.",
